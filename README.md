# Skivvy
An android device's maid.

## How to
### Run development
- This has been built natively upon android studio, just like any other basic android native application.
- The build.gradle file is not in the vcs, so proceed accordingly.

### Run stable
- The stable version(s) have been released under releases section of the repository.
- The release rights are still under the owner(s) of repository. You can contribute, or create a pull request when you want the owner(s) to consider releasing a new version.

## Features
### A Calculator++
Has its own calculation algorithm; tell your expression to be solved to Skivvy, and the algorithm is complex enough to give correct results in most of the cases.

### A Contact Manager
Calling, texting, emailing, and furthermore, third party app contact options(to be added), can be managed by Skivvy, on voice.
Can also listen and present incoming or outgoing calls (only the triggers, not the talks), no need to switch to any other app. Direct dial or email, whether it be in existing contacts or not.

### A Device Manager
Makes full use of available device features to serve the best of it. Can open any application, by any way told. Can control almost all functions of device (wi-fi, bluetooh, lock, etc.)

### Secured - Not Centrally Managed
- Doesn't use even a byte of network data, as every thing is in-app local algorithm. 
- Does all tasks on its own, not with the help of any kind of remote server.
- Has self security options, can make use of device's security features to protect itself.
- For easy access and non biometric support devices, has its own vocal authentication method.

### Note
- The speech to text recognition is being used of Google's built-in for all android devices.
- No third party api used so far, except for built-in Google Text-to-Speech and Google Voice Recognition features of android device.
