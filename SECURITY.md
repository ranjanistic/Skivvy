## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not explicitly report a vulnerability, so that it may become visible to everyone. To report a vulnerability, create an issue under bug tag
and try explaining which part of code has the problem, by not exposing how the vulnerability is able to exploit the product.

The issues are regularly being checked and maintained, and reported vulnerabilities will be worked upon within 24 hours of report.
